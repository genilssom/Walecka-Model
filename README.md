# Binding Energy and Saturation Density in the Walecka Model

This project contains a numerical solution to the problem of computing the
binding energy per nucleon in the Walecka model at zero temperature for
different values of the baryon density. The notebook reproduces results
from specific references and validatesthe use of given coupling constants.
